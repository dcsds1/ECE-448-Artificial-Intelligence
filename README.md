# Assighnments for Artificial Intelligence (ECE 448) in UIUC
## Games
In this part, we implemented Game of Breakthrough. Related algorithms and concepts are minimax search and alpha-beta search.
## Naive Bayes Classification
The goal of this assignment is to implement Naive Bayes classifiers and to apply it to the task of classifying visual patterns and text documents. 
## Machine Learning
Using perceptrons and k-nearest neighbour algorithms for digits classification. Compared different kind of features and performance of different classifiers.
